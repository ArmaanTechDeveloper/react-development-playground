# Task list application

Rapidly developed over two days, my task list app blends speed and efficiency. Initially crafted with React context for swift state management, it's now powered by Redux, offering a robust solution for streamlined task organization.

## [Context Version](https://github.com/ArmaanTechDeveloper/react-development-playground/tree/a3d74789a226270016c04ebb87fc71ec47491e1e/task-list)

The app the firstly implemented in context following some of best practices i learnt in due course of time.

The app was then migrated to redux again following some of the best practices and code seperation techniques.
